# Uribo Neural Network

This is a project that aims to create a Neural Network from scratch in order to understand the underlying mathematical concepts of Neural Networks.

# Pre-Requisites

Create a **virtual environment** with at least **python 3.12** and poetry installed.

# Installation

1. `clone` the repository somewhere in your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinher7/uribo-neural-network.git
```

2. The project uses poetry, so next install the dependencies with

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Then use the `start` script to execute the entrypoint

```bash
poetry run start
```

# Usage

It currently supports predicting a value using tanh activation functions for a given input.

# TODO

- Implement backpropagation
